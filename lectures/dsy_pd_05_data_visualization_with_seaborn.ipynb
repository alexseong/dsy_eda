    "# DATA VISUALIZATION WITH SEABORN\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn is a Python data visualization library with an emphasis on statistical plots. The library is an excellent resource for common regression and distribution plots, but where Seaborn really shines is in its ability to visualize many different features at once. It’s built to provide great visualizations and at the same time it makes developers’ life easier. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high level API that makes “a well-defined set of hard things easy”, amongst other things by making that its methods work greatly by passing a minimal set of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `great visualization` comes from the built in themes, the possibility to build custom attractive color palettes, and the witty way they’re utilized to display statistical plots (e.g. the kernel density estimation in a violin plot). Seaborn is part of the PyData stack, and accepts Pandas’ data structures as inputs in its API."

    "2. **FactorPlot / FacetGrid** - If we wanted to break down a plot by some categories, we needn’t perform boolean queries, nor groupbys, we can use FacetGrid.\n",
    "3. **[PairPlot](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html) / [PairGrid](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.PairGrid.html)** - Plot pairwise relationships in a dataset. This is a high-level interface for PairGrid that is intended to make it easy to draw a few common styles. You should use :class`PairGrid` directly if you need more flexibility.\n",
    "4. **JointPlot / JointGrid** - This method is used to display data points according to two variables, along with both their distributions, kernel density estimators, and an optional regression that fits the data. With “reg” we indicate that we want a regression fit to the data.\n",
    "5. **heatmap**: Heatmaps are ideal to plot “rectangular data” such as matrixes. They’re great to visualize when some values, or calculated values, such as averages, counts, etc. are more extreme."
